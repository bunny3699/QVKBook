                QVKBook is a web application which revolutionizes food services through its intricate yet user friendly interface that helps both the restaurants and customers to get the full benefit of ordering or booking online. One of the biggest challenges which restaurant owners face is balancing footfall, they usually have peak hours where majority of the crowd shows up and rest are off hours where restaurants are practically empty. QVKBook allow customers to book during these off hours and control footfall of the partnered restaurants. Another significant challenge the restaurant owners have to tackle is food wastage. QVKBook bridges the gap between restaurants with unsold food with customers looking for discounts, this eliminates last minute food wastage.
